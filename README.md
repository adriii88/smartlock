# Smart Locker

The locker may ensure that the bike is in charge of is properly locked if the owner closes it with his/her key and get unlocked if the user insert the key to remove the locker. There are many possibilities to solve this problem: many locker forms (settled on the bike, using a chain...) and different ways of locking and unlocking (a key, a password...).

The aim is to suggest an improvement of this features applying the technology available nowadays. The customers would be provided with an app that is associated to their bike. Due to that the individual could change the state of the lock without being in front of the bike - no patter the location. Furthermore, not only brings the possibility to borrow the bike to a friend while the owner is occupied with his/her business but to keep track of the state of the locker - seeing if by mistake the user forgot to lock the bike or if someone has tried to catch it or the tool has been broken by the weather or other possible factors. In addition, the app can provide the weather were the locker is placed in order to know if the user wants to wait until it stops raining for example.

According to that the new features added are the following:
  * ASFGHJK


command is received. The user can know the state standing in front of the bike thanks to a LED of the locker or in any location within his/her smartphone or computer.
