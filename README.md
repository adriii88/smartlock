# Smart Bike Lock

The lock may ensure that the bike is in charge of is properly locked if the owner closes it with his/her key and get unlocked if the user insert the key to remove the lock. There are many possibilities to solve this problem: many lock forms (settled on the bike, using a chain...) and different ways of locking and unlocking (a key, a password...).

The aim is to suggest an improvement of this features applying the technology available nowadays. The customers would be provided with an app that is associated to their bike. Due to that the individual could change the state of the lock without being in front of the bike - no patter the location. Furthermore, not only brings the possibility to borrow the bike to a friend while the owner is occupied with his/her business but to keep track of the state of the lock - seeing if by mistake the user forgot to lock the bike or if someone has tried to catch it or the tool has been broken by the weather or other possible factors. In addition, the app can provide the weather were the lock is placed in order to know if the user wants to wait until it stops raining for example.

According to that the new features added to the old regular lock are the following:
  * Remote control on the state of your parking lock
  * A physical light to make sure that is locked/unlocked without a device
  * Knowledge of the current state of the lock
  * The ability to use the weather of the location where is placed the bike
